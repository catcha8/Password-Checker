Password-Checker
Check your password securely without transmitting your password through internet.
You would need the internet to connect to API and obtain the response.

This project makes you to securely check if your password has been pwned or hacked.
It uses Troy Hunt's Have I Been Pwned API to get the passwords that have been leaked in the past using only the first five characters of the SHA1 generated password.

How is it secure
Well the Troy Hunt's website uses the same technique as this project does i.e, Hash K-anonimity.
Although if you are using the website to check Your password.
I find it still not secure because your password is still transmitting through the Internet.

How does this project help in this issue
This project is just a single python file that helps us run locally.
It uses the API of Have I Been Pwned website. Your computer needs to be connected to the Internet. 
But your password will not be transmitted through the Internet
